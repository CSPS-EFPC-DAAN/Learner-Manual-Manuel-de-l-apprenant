# Welcome to CSPS Digital Academy Premium Cohort 2

Congratulations again for having been selected to participate in the second iteration of the Canada School of Public Service Digital Academy Premium pilot!

Premium is an experimental, fast-paced, supportive learning experience to enable you to solve problems by working smarter, not harder, while increasing your knowledge and skills in areas deemed essential to success in delivering responsive and relevant services to Canadians

## How to use this Learner Manual
This learner manual is a reference tool to guide you before you begin and while you are engaged in this intensive and out-of-the-box learning experience. The purpose of this document is to cover most questions you may have throughout the process.

## Premium Learning Journey
Premium is a unique learning opportunity for public servants to develop their knowledge and skills in specialized areas such as Design, Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), Development and DevOps while exploring an organizational problem and solving it in a way that leads to a user-centered solution.

Through a mix of in-person and virtual learning activities, you will discover the art of the possible with respect to digital tools and approaches, and experience what working in an accelerator feels like as you spend 12 days during the capstone Practicum prototyping a solution to a real business problem with a multidisciplinary team. 

By the end of Premium, you will not only have gained new knowledge, skills and a better appreciation of what advanced digital technology and approaches can do for you and your organization, but also strengthened your ability to identify the real source of a problem, engage with stakeholders and people impacted by the problem or the solution, and prototype, test and pitch your proposed solution. In the process, you will be exposed to diverse perspectives and build a network of like-minded individuals across the public service. 

Premium is more than a learning product: it’s a community that will be there to support you along your learning journey, during Premium but also afterwards, as you work on implementing what you have learned in your home organization. Welcome to our family!  

## Learning Approach
Premium has three main learning components: 

Stream-based learning, where two days a week for 7 weeks individuals enhance their knowledge and skills in a specialized area through instructor-led activities and self-study. 

Common learning, where learners from all streams, once or twice a week over the same 7 weeks, are introduced to cross-cutting topics such as accessibility, working in the open and agile, via short webinars.

Problem-based learning, where learners explore their problems and share their learning with their team through weekly learning circles over the same 7-week period. This component also includes the initial in-person bootcamp in Ottawa, where learners are introduced to user-centered design and problem definition, as well as the 12-day capstone Practicum, when learners ideate, prototype, test and pitch a solution to the problem selected by their team.

Refer to the [Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1drNXGc4GBlAP3fsTaMfUWbK2VQGbc8bA/edit#gid=1127847901) for an overview of the schedule for each week.

### Stream-based learning 
**The Data Learning Stream**
The Data stream provides a survey of the concepts and skills essential for becoming a data practitioner. This includes a review of the different parts of the data pipeline and relevant skills and concepts required to work with each part of this pipeline, from data collection to data presentation. Specific topics including data architectures, measures and metrics, data validation and data visualization.

**The Dev Learning Stream**
The Development stream will equip learners with the knowledge and skills in the areas of front end development including version control (Git), command line (Bash,SSH), HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python. Participants will learn how-to use open source tools to build a POC (Proof of Concept) and an MVP (Minimum-Viable Product). The course will also review the Agile development methodology, accessibility standards, and basic security concepts.

**The DevOps Learning Stream**
The DevOps stream includes the latest principles and practices from the DevOps community in the Government of Canada and industry experts. By the end of this training, learners will be able to write scripts using Python, understand the nuances of Open Source Software as it relates to Software Developers and Operators, as well as build and deploy Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, and more.

**The Design Learning Stream**
The Design stream will allow learners to better understand design as a practice. The course will equip learners with knowledge and skills in the areas of ethical and inclusive service design, user research, problem definition and solution prototyping, content design, usability testing and iteration, measuring for impact, partnership building, and stewardship.

**The AI/ML Learning Stream**
The AI/ML stream provides an overview of the concepts and skills required to become a data scientist. It will include fundamental concepts common to data work (data preparation, data visualization) and an overview of the main branches of machine learning, including supervised learning (classification and value estimation) and unsupervised learning (association rules and clustering). An emphasis in the AI/ML stream will be on exercises in R where learners will implement techniques learned during stream-based learning using relevant datasets and specific R libraries.

### Common Learning
Common learning is content and topics relevant to all streams that all learners are expected to attend. It is typically delivered on Mondays and Tuesdays from 2:00-3:30pm ET. The complete list of topics, with dates, can be found on Premium’s Moodle space. The sessions are delivered virtually, recorded for future reference and posted on Moodle. Their goal is to ensure all learners share a common understanding of key concepts underpinning the new way of thinking and doing expected of public servants as they tackle emerging problems and develop solutions that are timely and effective. Some of these concepts are studied in more depth in the different streams.

### Problem-based Learning
One of the main objectives of Premium is to enhance your ability to identify business problems (and not just their symptoms) in order to develop effective solutions that could have a real impact on your organisation and the life of Canadians. This is why we asked you, as part of the registration process, to submit a problem to explore during Premium. 

1. **One-week in-person Bootcamp**

You will be introduced to the importance of identifying the right problem before developing a solution. Our expert design thinking practitioners will lead you through a series of group and individual exercises on problem definition. You will also get to know your team.

Teams, which will be formed prior to bootcamp, will be typically made of 5 to 8 learners with representatives from each stream. You will share and collaborate with your team during your entire Premium journey, including during Practicum when you will be prototyping a solution for a real business problem. 

2. **7 weeks of part-time learning through work on problem and sharing in the learning circles**

Following Bootcamp, you will meet with your team once a week for 1.5-2 hours in your learning circle, whose objectives is to provide all team members an opportunity to:
* share what they have learned in their respective stream
* discuss ways to implement what they have learned in their daily work, including how to deal with potential barriers
* share what they have learned on their problem

You will also have an activity to do each week to deepen the understanding of your problem. For example, one week we may ask you to do field work and go talk to stakeholders and people impacted by your problem; another week, we may ask you to identify data sources that could be used to gain a better understanding of your problem or to develop a future solution. Weekly problem-based assignments and resources will be posted on Moodle. In addition, our team of design thinking practitioners will be available by appointment to help when necessary. An advisor will also be assigned to your team. Your advisor will help you achieve your goals by providing access to experts and mentors when you need it, pointing you to relevant resources, and helping remove administrative barriers. Advisors call everyone in their team individually once a week to inquire about how they’re doing. They are also present at the first two learning circles to get the team started on its learning journey. 

Teams are responsible for setting a time and place for their learning circles each week. Participation is mandatory, and it can be virtual or in-person. You will be given time, on the last day of the bootcamp (November 1st), to agree on a time for the weekly learning circles (for example every Thursday from 1:00-2:30 ET) and book it in your calendars. 

It’s important to note that only one problem per team will be selected for practicum. Teams will be involved in the selection, which may occur during the bootcamp or later in the process. By the time the practicum rolls around, each team will have a well-defined problem and have identified the data sources required to prototype a solution. Even if your problem is not selected, this should not prevent you from exploring it on your own, applying what you have learned.

3. **2-week practicum, including Demo Day**

During the first 3 days of the practicum, you will have the opportunity, with your team, to brainstorm potential innovative solutions to the problem you have selected, pick one for prototyping and start planning the development of your prototype using agile approaches and methods. During the following prototyping phase, in addition to your advisor, you will have access to experts, mentors and agile coaches to support you. You will have the opportunity to learn more about pitching, and will present your proof of concept and prototype at least three times during the practicum, including on Demo Day, where you will show your colleagues, your managers and a panel of executives from across the government what you have managed to achieve in two short weeks. We guarantee they will be impressed - and so will you.

Demo Day marks the official end of Premium, but not of your learning journey with us. You will join our community and be invited to all the major events we organize. We will also follow up regularly with you on how you’ve implemented what you’ve learned in your organization, and give you advice on how to remove barriers.
