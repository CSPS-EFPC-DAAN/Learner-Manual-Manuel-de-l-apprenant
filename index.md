Two days after the Launch party, we will be pleased to welcome you to your first in-class Premium experience. We will meet from 9:00am-4:00pm for an orientation in the morning and the first module in the afternoon.

Following the first week, we will have lab hours or designated learning events from 9:00am-12:00pm and modules from 1:00-4:00pm. This will all take place at 111 Sussex Drive.
 
Please note that participation for the entire duration of the course is mandatory. At 4pm every Thursday, you will receive a short evaluation which will help improve the Premium experience for future cohorts: your participation is managed through the completion of the weekly evaluation.

# Useful Info

# For Your Action

We have a few last questions before your Digital Academy experience begins:
 
1. **Will you be attending the Premium launch party on Tuesday, January 29?** An Outlook invitation will be sent shortly. Please confirm your attendance by Friday, January 25.
2. **Fill out your learner manual for me**, a guide for your professors and fellow learners to understand how you like to learn and work. Bullet points or a few sentences per question will do. The “manuals” will be shown at the launch party on January 29th and will be available online by the first day of class.
3. As learners of Premium’s first cohort, you’ll be receiving some fun gear. **What’s your sweater size?** XS-XXL.
4. **Do you have any allergies (food, environmental, other)?**

Please send your “learner manual for me” and answers by Friday, January 25 to <csps.premiumdigitalacademy-excelenceacademiquedunumerique.efpc@canada.ca>.

Should you have any questions, please contact us at the Digital Academy.
 
Thank you for participating in the beta cohort of the CSPS Digital Academy - Premium! We look forward to meeting you soon.
